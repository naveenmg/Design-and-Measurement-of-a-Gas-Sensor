# Design and Measurement of a Gas Sensor

### Task

The aim of this project is to develop a semiconductor gas sensor to measure the concentration of methane. Metal oxide sensors are also known as chemiresistors. The detection principle of resistive sensors is based on the change of resistance of a thin film upon adsorption of the gas molecules on the surface of a semiconductor. The gas-solid interactions affect the resistance of the film because of the density of electronic species in the film.

Two substrates consisting of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) are given for this project. The development processes will be explained in the following chapters. It includes sputtering, design of the electrode structure, laser structuring, microscopy, design and layout of a printed circuit board (PCB), soldering and testing.

## Structure of the gas sensor

In order to be able to apply the principle of operation a pattern of conductors has to be created between two contact surfaces. These surfaces as well as the conductors consist of a thin layer of platinum which itself is on top of a non-conductive substrate. Above the platinum pattern there is a layer of tin oxide, but at the contacting surfaces the platinum is still exposed. In order to make the effect (change in resistance) easier to measure, the surface area of the pattern should be as high as possible. This is achieved by having small distances between the conductors in the pattern. Since the effect occurs mainly in the space charge zone, the reaction material should be applied only in a thin layer.
